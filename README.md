# BridgeCounter3
An app to help those with moblity issues keep score of bridge.
You can tap boxes that say trickscore or premiumscore to enter the points, 
when you wish to submit the points, hit the enter score button.
If a score of 100 or more is entered into one of the teams' premiumscore, a line is drawn 
underneath to show a game has been won.
When a game has been won previous scores remain on the activity but are uneditable.
After a team has won two games then that team has won the rubber and no one can enter anymore scores.


\nThings to be included in the future:
\n A way of recording a new rubber without closing and restarting the app.
\nA toast to say when a team has won a rubber.
